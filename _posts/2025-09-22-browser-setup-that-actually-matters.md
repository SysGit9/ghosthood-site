title: The Browser Setup That Actually Moves the Needle (2025)
excerpt: A five-step Firefox setup that cuts tracking radically without breaking your web.
---

Most “privacy guides” throw every extension under the sun at your browser and call it a day. That’s noise. You need a setup that measurably reduces surveillance and still lets you live on the web.

## The Five Moves
1. **Firefox + Multi-Account Containers**  
   Compartmentalize identities. Shopping stays in one jar, social in another. Cross-site tracking falls on its face.

2. **uBlock Origin (default, not “medium mode”)**  
   Baseline protection with minimal breakage. Enable the extra lists only if needed.

3. **DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or Encrypted DNS system-wide**  
   Your ISP sells your traffic history. Stop feeding them. Use a reputable resolver with no-logging commitments.

4. **Resist Fingerprinting (minimal tweaks)**  
   Don’t chase uniqueness. You want to *blend*. Avoid exotic fonts/extensions that make you stand out.

5. **Separate Browser/Profile for Always-Logged-In Accounts**  
   Banks, work SSO, etc. Put them in a dedicated profile or secondary browser. Containment beats cleanup.

## What Not to Do
- Don’t stack 10 adblockers. One good blocker beats five fighting each other.  
- Don’t run “privacy” extensions that phone home. Audit permissions; if it wants everything, it gets nothing.

## Quick Start
- Install **Firefox**, **Multi-Account Containers**, **uBlock Origin**.  
- Create containers: *Work*, *Personal*, *Shopping*, *Social*. Color-code them.  
- Set encrypted DNS (DoH) in Firefox **or** at the OS level.
