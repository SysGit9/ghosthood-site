excerpt: "Cut the attack surface first. Depth can come later. Here’s the order of operations."

You don’t need a week-long retreat in the woods to get safer. Give me 90 minutes and we’ll pull your footprint out of the red.

## 0–20 min: Accounts & Auth
- **Password manager** (Bitwarden or 1Password—pick one).  
- **Turn on 2FA** for email, bank, Apple/Google, password manager itself.  
- **Kill SMS-only 2FA** where possible; prefer authenticator apps or security keys.

## 20–45 min: Email Hygiene
- Set **server-side filters** that auto-archive promotions.  
- Create **aliases** for high-risk signups.  
- Unsubscribe in bulk—less mail = fewer phish.

## 45–70 min: Device Sanity
- Update OS, browsers, drivers.  
- Remove unused apps.  
- Lock screens at 5 minutes; disk encryption on.

## 70–90 min: Data Brokers (the quick win)
- Remove your info from the top aggregators. Start with the biggest three; calendar a monthly sweep.

## Aftercare
- Review critical accounts quarterly.  
- Replace reused passwords on sight.  
- Keep your setup minimal, predictable, and boring. Boring is hard to hack.
