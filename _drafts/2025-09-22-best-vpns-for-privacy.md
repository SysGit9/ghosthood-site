Most VPN ads scream about “complete anonymity,” but not every VPN deserves your trust. A real privacy-focused VPN hinges on **jurisdiction, logging policy, audits, and transparency**—not just slick ads.

## Quick Comparison

| VPN | Jurisdiction | Logging Policy | Price (mo) | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----|--------------|----------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Proton VPN** | Switzerland | No logs, independently audited | $4.99+ | Open-source apps, strong Swiss privacy laws, Proton ecosystem | Free tier is limited |
| **Mullvad** | Sweden | No logs, anonymous signup | €5 flat | Pay with cash/crypto, no email, transparency | Smaller server network |
| **NordVPN** | Panama | No logs, independently audited | $3.99+ | Massive network, fast, streaming friendly | Marketing-heavy, not fully open-source |
| **ExpressVPN** | British Virgin Islands | No logs, independently audited | $6.67+ | Reliable worldwide, consistent speeds | Pricey |

## Proton VPN: Swiss-Backed Security
Proton VPN comes from the team behind ProtonMail. Swiss privacy law, open-source apps, and repeated audits make it a top pick.
> **Best for:** People who want an all-in-one privacy ecosystem.

## Mullvad: Maximum Anonymity
No email to sign up. Pay with cash or crypto. Flat €5. Radical transparency and a consistent no-logs stance.
> **Best for:** The closest thing to true anonymity online.

## NordVPN: The Mainstream Heavyweight
Huge server footprint, fast, audited, and feature-rich (Meshnet, Double VPN). More commercial vibe, but it performs.
> **Best for:** Speed + convenience without deep tinkering.

## ExpressVPN: Reliable, but Premium
BVI jurisdiction, multiple audits, famously steady for travelers and geo-restricted sites. You pay for the polish.
> **Best for:** Frequent travelers needing rock-solid uptime.

## How to Choose
- **Maximum anonymity:** Mullvad  
- **Privacy + ecosystem tools:** Proton VPN  
- **Streaming + speed:** NordVPN or ExpressVPN

> No VPN is a silver bullet. But the right one dramatically cuts the data harvested about you daily.
